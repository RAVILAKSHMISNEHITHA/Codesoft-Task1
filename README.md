## Overview of the Project

### Project: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Objective:
The primary objective of analyzing the Titanic dataset is to predict passenger survival based on various factors like age, sex, class, fare, and family relationships.

### Key Activities:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and remove unnecessary columns.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use statistical methods and visualizations to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict passenger survival.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

### Technologies:
1. **Python**: Main programming language used for data analysis and model building.

2. **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.

3. **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

4. **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

5. **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for writing and running code.

### Key Insights:
1. **Survival Rate by Gender**: Women had a significantly higher survival rate compared to men.

2. **Survival Rate by Class**: Passengers in the first class had a higher survival rate compared to those in the second and third classes.

3. **Impact of Age**: Younger passengers had a higher chance of survival compared to older passengers.

4. **Family Size**: Passengers with smaller family sizes had a higher likelihood of survival.
